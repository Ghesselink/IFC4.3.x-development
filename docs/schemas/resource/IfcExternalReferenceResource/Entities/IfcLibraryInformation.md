# IfcLibraryInformation

> NOTE This functionality has been superseded by the URI convention in IFC. More info on the use of URI references in different IFC versions can be found on [this documentation page](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/blob/master/Documentation/bSDD-IFC%20documentation.md). The use of IfcLibraryInformation is discouraged. 

An _IfcLibraryInformation_ describes an external structured store of information, normally organized in a manner which allows information lookup through an index or reference value. _IfcLibraryInformation_ provides the library _Name_ and optional _Description_, _Version_, _VersionDate_ and _Publisher_ attributes. A _Location_ may be added for electronic access to the library.
